# Mortgage Calculator
A web app built with React that calculates monthly mortgage payment based on principal amount, amortization period, interest rate, and down payment.


## Details

#### Behavior

mortgage-calc dynamically calculates the monthly mortgage payment, meaning that when one of the parameters is changed, the monthly payment is automatically calculated (eg: changing amortization period automatically re-calculates the down payment and monthly mortgage payment). In addition, changing either down payment amount or % will automatically re-calculate mortgage amount and monthly payment.

Parameters for monthly payment calculation:
* principal amount
* down payment %
* down payment
* mortgage rate
* amortization period

#### Tools Used
mortgage-calc was built using React, and testing was done using react-testing-library.

#### Requirements
* UI is fully responsive (works on phones, tablets, and larger screens).
* Works on common browsers (Google Chrome, Mozilla Firefox, Safari, Microsoft Edge, Internet Explorer (version 11+).
* Lightweight (3.12 MB).
* No external requirements/packages needed to run mortgage-calc.
* Works on single page applications.
